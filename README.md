# AGW
Adaptive Gaussian Window MATLAB function

GitHub posted version of Adaptive Gaussian Window filter described in Cowen & Monismith (1997) Expieriments in Fluids manuscript based on
the 2006 CEE 6370 version.  Allows for multi-component data with one independent variable (e.g., 2-D velocity data sampled in time).  

The provide example script, agw_test.m, is two component but 1,2,3 or more components work fine.
